The aim of this study is to examine the influence of geospatial features (GSF) on performance of machine learning models for predicting volume of water consumed by poor urban households. This study is necessary to provide solution to the problem of access to safe water for poor people living within urban areas in low-income countries. Accurately predicting volume of water consumed is the first step towards extending water distribution network to poor people, and solving the problem of lack of access to safe water. Thus, it is necessary to examine how GSF influence model performance.
